    <p id="1">1 It is estimated that the ancestors of most big cats split away from the Felinae about 6.37 million
        years ago.</p>
    <p id="2"> 2 [4] The Felinae, on the other hand, comprises mostly small to medium-sized cats, including the
        domestic cats,
        but also some larger cats such as the cougar and cheetah.[5] </p>
    <p id="3"> 3 A 2010 study published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution has given insight into the exact
        evolutionary
        relationships of the big cats.
        [6] The study reveals that the snow leopard and the tiger are sister species, while the lion, leopard, and
        jaguar are more closely related to each other.
        The tiger and snow leopard diverged from the ancestral big cats approximately 3.9 Ma.</p>
